# Arduino Robotics, Summer 2014

This class repository contains homework assignments, useful guides, and code for "Arduino Robotics" at CCA, summer 2014.

### Monday, June 2, 2014

Lecture:
- Introduction
- Discussion of goals, projects, robots, Arduino
- Lots of digressions into very technical topics, including binary, coordinate systems, and trigonometry. (We went very quickly over these topics -- don't worry if they didn't make super much sense. We'll talk more about these topics in the future, and lots of stuff will start to make sense once we get hands-on.)

Hands-on:
- Arduino IDE
- Breadboard

#### Homework 1 (due Wednesday, June 4, 2014)

- [Download](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and [install](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) the Arduino IDE (get version 1.0.5, not 1.5!) on your laptop.
- Watch the first episode of [AdaFruit's Circuit Playground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlRjDKHGRg)
- Read through the [Blink tutorial](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink) that we talked about in class.
- A bit more complicated: read through the [Digital Read Serial code](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalReadSerial) -- it'll probably feel very complicated, don't worry about that.
- Prof. Shiloh has a [sheet of basic math exercises](http://teachmetomake.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/basicMathExercises.pdf). Do one out of every five exercises. Bring questions to Wednesday's class.
- Bring your laptop on Wednesday!
